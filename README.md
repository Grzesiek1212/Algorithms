**Course Overview**

This repository contains solutions to approximately 15 exercises from a university course on algorithms and data structures. The course aims to develop skills in constructing efficient algorithms and selecting appropriate data structures, covering topics such as dynamic programming, backtracking algorithms, greedy algorithms, and the divide and conquer principle. The course also includes efficient graph algorithms and other domains.
